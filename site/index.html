                <h3>40 years experience</h3>
                <p>I initially trained under the direction and guidance of three Certified Examiners who were engaged in full-time, private practices. My training began in 1970 and required nearly four years to complete. As experience is a great teacher - training has continued now for more that 35 years.</p>
                <p>I was first recognized by the courts as a qualified expert in 1973.</p>
                <p>I was certified by written testing, oral examination and review of my files by the Independent Association of Questioned Document Examiners in 1984. I later served one term on the Board of Directors of IAQDE.</p>
                <p>I was certified by the Association of Forensic Document Examiners in 1991. I have served two terms as Treasurer, one term as President and one term on the Board of Directors of&nbsp;<a href="http://afde.org">AFDE.</a></p>
                <p>I am currently serving as President of the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.bdfe.org">Board of Forensic Document Examiners.</a></p>
                <p>I have made more than 150 appearances in State and Federal courts.</p>
