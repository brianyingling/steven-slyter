        h3 Over 40 years experience
        p I initially trained under the direction and guidance of three Certified Examiners who were engaged in full-time, private practices. My training began in 1970 and required nearly four years to complete. As experience is a great teacher - training has continued now for more that 35 years.
        p I was first recognized by the courts as a qualified expert in 1973.
        p I was certified by written testing, oral examination and review of my files by the Independent Association of Questioned Document Examiners in 1984. I later served one term on the Board of Directors of IAQDE.
        p I was certified by the Association of Forensic Document Examiners in 1991. I have served two terms as Treasurer, one term as President and one term on the Board of Directors of&nbsp;

        p I am currently serving as President of the&nbsp;
